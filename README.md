## Flatnotes

## Description

This webapp is designed to allow users to create and view notes. This repo is the Rails API backend. See the frontend [here](https://github.com/KRStoddard/mod4_project_frontend).

## Running the webapp

Please run bundle install, rake db:create, and rake db:migrate. Then you can start the server using rails s -p 3001.


## Project Requirements

The guidelines here are minimal but be sure that you:

* Use a Rails API backend with a separate React frontend that are created in two different Github repositories.
* Have at least three resources (three DB tables) on the backend and your application must have full CRUD actions for at least one resource.
* Must have at least two different client-side routes (i.e. use react-router). Ex: even if your whole app is mostly a single page app, have the form to signup be found at /signup
* Optional: Your application can have authentication/authorization. You are welcome to use an auth template as discussed in class.
